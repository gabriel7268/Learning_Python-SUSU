    "\n",
    "Because tuples are immutable, they don't provide methods like __sort__ and __reverse__, which modify existing lists.

Compound data structures are useful, but they are prone to what I call *shape errors*; that is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size, or composition, or perhaps you write some code and forget the shape of your data and introduce an error. For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won't work."
